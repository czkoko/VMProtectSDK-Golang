# VMProtectSDK-Golang
``UnOfficial VMProtectSDK for Golang``

````
Due to the particularity of Golang, VMP is not compatible with it. 

For example, there is no 0 at the end of the Golang string, 

and ABI is non-standard(GO x64 ABI: RAX, RBX, RCX, RDI, RSI, R8, R9, R10, R11)

If use CGO, VMP does not recognize Marker and the string need to encrypt,

After a while of research, I solved the compatibility of some VMProtect with Golang.

Now VMProtect can recognize the address of VMProtectBegin and VMProtectEnd.

MarkerName and the string need to encrypt all can be detected(work well on mac and win).

Because of I didn't have Web License Manager, so the correlation function has not been implemented.

Most functions are Bind.

* Test work well on window 11 and Mac OS 12.3.1 (Go 1.18.1),Linux not tested,According to the feedback, it is okay.

* After disassembly viewing the protected program,with memory protection and pack turned off, 

  the marked code are successfully protected by VMProtect, and the encrypted string cannot be searched, 
  
  proving that VMProtect and Golang are compatible and the protection is effective.

Guide：

  Copy "VMProtect" and "example" folder to "/Users/YourName/go/src/"

  Please install the c compiler if not.
 
  Mac: xcode-select --install
  Mac Cross build PE: sudo port install x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc or download llvm-mingw
  Windows: download llvm-mingw
  
  Modify the build script,set the CC
  
  run the script to build

Tip:

1.\x00 or \000 must be added after string ,like VMProtect.BeginUltra("Marker\x00").

2.Don't use the -gcflags "-N -l" command to compile , Otherwise VMP cannot recognize the Marker.

3.Must use -ldflags "-s -w" to strip the Symbol，Otherwise VMP cannot recognize the file.

4.Refer to the files in the example folder and modify the GoPath.

5.If necessary, add scripts in script.lua for additional protection.

6.Linux has not been tested. Maybe, but some of the code needs to be modified.

7.You must use VMProtect.GoString to convert func DecryptString's char to string,not C.GoString.

8.32-bit systems are not supported..
  
9.If you import other projects from github, please set GO111MODULE=on and modify go.mod,
   replace VMProtect => /Users/YourName/go/src/VMProtect.
